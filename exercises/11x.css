/*
  In styles/11-todo-list.css, we used align-items: stretch in the .todo-input-grid to fix an alignment issue caused by align-items: center.
  
  Initially, we applied align-items: center to both .todo-grid and .todo-input-grid to vertically center elementsâ€”especially the delete buttons in each todo row. However, this had an unintended side effect in the top input section (.todo-input-grid): the "Add" button became vertically misaligned with the input fields.
  
  To resolve this, we specifically set align-items: stretch on .todo-input-grid, which restored the default stretching behavior and made the "Add" button align properly with the input fields.
  
  By keeping align-items: center for .todo-grid and overriding it with align-items: stretch for .todo-input-grid, we achieved the desired layout for both sections.
